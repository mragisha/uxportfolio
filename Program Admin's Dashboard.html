                This is a feature of Cisco's Lifecycle Advantage (LCA), designed for Program Admin to track the activity of Partners in the email campaign. 
      
            <p>
                Background of LCA: <br>
LCA is a customer engagement program for Cisco Partners that promotes adoption, simplifies renewals,
 and upsells to higher-value solutions. It uses action triggered email automation.<br>

Partners bring in customer contacts, to whom the automated emails are sent in groups
 depending on the Location, Journey, or Offer.

                <p style="margin-top: 4vh; ">In a team of two, I was involved in understanding requirements by collaborating with the 
                    Engineering team, Project Managers, Previous Designers, and the Users.</p>
                <p>
                    Organic cycles of requirement analysis, brainstorming, design iterations, and feedback for around 8 weeks
                     lead us to reach the final version of the dashboard which was technically feasible and delightful for
                      the users.

                <p style="margin-top: 8vh; ">
                    The initial set of requirements were compiled and shared by the Project Manager. A sneak peek of the same
                     is attached below. As we went through the process of brainstorming, wireframing, and gathering feedback 
                     from the team, the requirements expanded to around 70%. These came down organically with every meeting
                      (held weekly).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was found that the requirements captured in the document were incomplete and changed a lot as designs
                     got feedback.

                    It was found that the information needs to be seen at levels. This was the reason that it can be 
                    divided into categories and sub-categories. Program Admins would be checking out Partners' 
                    details, the status of their activity with the email campaign, and then would like to dig more 
                    into one partner to check the list of customers/opportunities, their details associated 
                    with the partner.

                <p style="margin-top: 4vh; ">After every cycle of gathering User/Business requirements,
                     taking feedback, ideating, and designing, a bunch of new challenges was encountered every time.</p>
                
                <p>
                    There was an increasing set of requirements in the form of data and filters to be applied to the data.
                     The data was to be sectioned broadly into Partner information and Customer information, the count of 
                     each of them could go around 1000s. And the information of each is divided into around 15-20 sections. 
                </p>

                <p style=" text-align:center; margin-top:2vh; color:#7c7c7c">Design iterations of the dashboard with changing priorities</p>
                </div>
            
            <div class="ideation">

                <p>The designs were required to be aligned with pre-defined guideline being local to the company. The wireframes
                     could be quickly converted to high-fidelity mockups complete with the visual design. A couple of 
                     iterations are attached below, which were proved to be very helpful in getting User's feedback.
                      These design ideas along with the feedback were a game changer as these were very different concepts
                       from what was anticipated by the Engineering team and Managers taking care of the product since its 
                       birth.</p>
                <p>
                    In the first design, the concept of one screen was promoted wherein all the information can be checked 
                    out easily on one screen with few interactions, making it easy to compare the switch around between 
                    different partners
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="imagegrp" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
                <img src="portfolioimages/program/Group 18.png" width="50%" height="50%" style="margin-top: 10vh; margin-left: 20vw; border: 1px solid rgb(139, 139, 139);">
                <p style=" text-align:center; margin-top:2vh; color:#7c7c7c">Design for the use-case of data comparison </p>
                </div>
            <div class="ideation">
                <p>
                    The second design was more towards giving focused view on the information of one partner with their 
                    customers/opportunities. It involved two levels of information along with different set of filters.

                <p style="margin-top: 4vh; ">
                    As the designs came through the brainstorming sessions with team, there were 4 major challenges 
                    encountered:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A huge amount of data to showcase on a desktop screen satisfying every use case</li>
                        <li>Filtering out the information as required</li>
                        <li>No clear distinction or categories defined for the information and a vast vareity of use cases.</li>
                        <li>Catering the use case of checking the information offline while sharing offline over meetings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p> 
                    While brainstorming and designing, these challenges were solved: 
                <ul>
                    <li>With the use of tables and combination of filters, the information was presented 
                        to fit almost every use case</li>
                    <li>Using a combination of Visual Filters, Inline/In-column filters for best possible
                         results with a huge amount of data.</li>
                    <li>Understanding and analysing the requirements by users' mouth word by word.
                         Iterating designs and failing fast</li>
                    <li>The capability of downloading report  with additional columns and applied
                         filters and visual cues.</li>

                The users put down their thoughts in the comments on the InVision prototype after a walk-through
                 meeting for every phase.They had few demands, questions, discussions as well as good 
                 suggestions on the different iterations of designs. <br>
                Reading, analyzing and after having followed up meetings on these comments, we modified the 
                designs and came down to a version that best suited their requirements and the work environment.

                        As the final version, there were combination filters, a ton

                    As a result of this organic process, we could come up with a design that was working well and also satisfied the users' expectations with visual aspects as well as different features with minor interactions.<br> 
We were appreciated by the Engineering Team and Managers for the quick good work on the project.<br>
Credit goes to the quick users' response over the meetings as well as on InVision Prototype, and smooth collaboration with the Engineering Team.
